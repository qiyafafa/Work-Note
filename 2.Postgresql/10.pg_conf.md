## Memory relative

```sh
If only running postgres on the server:
    work_mem = Total RAM / max_connections / 8
If there are other software running on the server:
    work_mem = Total RAM / max_connections / 16

maintenance_work_mem 
    5% * total ram
max_stack_depth
    8MB lower than the (ulimit -s)
effective_cache_size = 16000MB  # 75% * total ram
shared_buffers = 6000MB         # 25% * total ram, if there are other softwares, use total memory - memory of the softwares will use
checkpoint_segments =  64       # Accord to the view mnt.checkpoint to set this value, changed to min_wal_size , max_wal_size after 9.5
checkpoint_timeout = 15min 
wal_buffers = 16MB
```
