# 2. How many wal files the pg will keep in the wal directory?
# 3. How many memory will the checkpointer process will consume? 
It seems the memory the checkpointer consumed will work aroud to the shared_buffers of the pg.

# 4. How to check the wal status in pg 
```sql
select pg_stat_reset();
select pg_stat_reset_shared('bgwriter');
select * FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;

drop view mnt.checkpoint;
create view  mnt.checkpoint as 
SELECT
total_checkpoints,
case when total_checkpoints = 0 then 0 
else
seconds_since_start / total_checkpoints / 60 
end AS minutes_between_checkpoints
FROM ( SELECT
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - stats_reset)) AS seconds_since_start,
            (checkpoints_timed+checkpoints_req) AS total_checkpoints
    FROM pg_stat_bgwriter
) AS sub;

select * from mnt.checkpoint;
```
