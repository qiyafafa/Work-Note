## 1. Error:  could not accept SSL connection : EOF detected
We can access the database via 127.0.0.1 with SSL, but we can not access via the public ip.
The listen_address contain the public ip and , pg_hba.conf also has allowd the public ip access.

Reason:
At the end , we found that the public ip is not availble when our process is starting.
It is DHCP issue.
