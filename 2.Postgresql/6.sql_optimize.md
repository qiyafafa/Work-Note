# 1. How to write a sql procedure with high performance
It is difficult to make a standard to write a fast sql procedure.But some method can be resort.

-  Do not write a very large sql procedure, we would better limit the lines smaller than 300.
-  Do not use temp table , if the sql procedure is invoked very frequently.
-  You should know how much data your sql procedure will process, if the data is too huge, we should split 
   the process by batch process.

# 2. How to count a big table rows quickly?
There are 6142812 row data in my table. 
```sql
db1=# select count(*) from tmp.test;
  count
---------
 6142812
(1 row)
```

When i count the rows , it take about 6 seconds.
## 2.1 Add turn off the seq scan  before the count sql , it only take 2.5 seconds.

```sql
set enable_seqscan=off;
explain analyze select count(*) from tmp.test;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=214515.22..214515.23 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=2053.217..2053.218 rows=1 loops=1)
   ->  Index Only Scan using me_2018081510_idx2 on me_2018081510  (cost=0.43..199158.92 rows=6142518 width=0) (actual time=0.026..1514.419 rows=6142812 loops=1)
         Heap Fetches: 6142812
 Planning time: 0.106 ms
 Execution time: 2053.247 ms

```
## 2.1 There is a way to speed this up dramatically if the count does not have to be exact like it seems to be in your case.
```sql
SELECT reltuples::bigint AS estimate FROM pg_class where oid = to_regclass('tmp.test');

--same with above sql 
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tmp.test;
                               QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tmp.test  (cost=0.00..129024.88 rows=6142588 width=57)
```
