# 1. How to write a sql procedure with high performance
It is difficult to make a standard to write a fast sql procedure.But some method can be resort.

-  Do not write a very large sql procedure, we would better limit the lines smaller than 300.
-  Do not use temp table , if the sql procedure is invoked very frequently.
-  You should know how much data your sql procedure will process, if the data is too huge, we should split 
   the process by batch process.
