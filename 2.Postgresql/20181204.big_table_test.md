# Big table performance test

## Hardware
Memory: 8GB
CPU:    4 core
Disk Speed: 

## Insert about 613635584 rows data in table t1 
It took about 2.5 days. After that add new data in this table is very slow.

## Test cases
Clone a table named t2 from t1 and insert 1344130 rows test data.

## Case 1 : Insert 1000 rows data into two tables
```sql
t1 cost about 1s
t2 cost about 0ms
```

## Case 2: Insert into 10000 rows data in to two tables
```sql
t1 cost about 3s
t2 cost about 180ms
```

## Case 3: Query by a row which have btree index
```sql
t1 cost about 15ms
t2 cost about 10ms
```

## Case 4: Query by join other small table, t2 and t3 are dict tables
```sql
select 
        count(*)
    from t2 c 
    inner join t1 d on d.class_id = c.id
    inner join t3 lc on d.loc_id = lc.id
    where c.name = 'name_385'; 

t1 cost about 210ms
t2 cost about 17ms 
```
## Case 5: Base case 4 and do some aggregate of about 600000 rows data 
```sql
select  sum(d.id)
    from t2 c
    inner join t1 d on d.class_id = c.id
    inner join t3 lc on d.loc_id = lc.id
    where c.name = 'name_385'
    group by d.date

t1 cost about 680ms
t2 cost about 20ms
```
