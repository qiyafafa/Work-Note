# 1.sql cause
## 1.1 create temp table and batch insert 450 000 000 rows data

It took 3443.094s to insert all the data , use python batch insert, and reopen
the connection every batch.

```
create table tmp.test3 (id bigint, name text);
create index test3_idx on tmp.test3 (id);

insert into tmp.test3
    select t.id, 'jeremy'||t.id
        from (select generate_series(1,10000) id) t;
```

Run the following sql only cost Time: 64.808 ms use index.

```
select * from tmp.test3 where id between 2090000 and 2100000 ;
```

# 2.pg vaccuum
## 2.1 pg routine task auto vacuum take long time , for example:
### 2.1.1 pg system tables auto vacuum 
#### Issue:
We maybe find the following long time task in the database:
```
00:40:37.802856 | autovacuum: VACUUM ANALYZE pg_catalog.pg_attribute
00:03:39.330058 | autovacuum: VACUUM ANALYZE pg_catalog.pg_class
```
The following tables are several MB in normal, but size is very big in this case:
```
pg_catalog.pg_attribute | 4675 MB
pg_catalog.pg_class     | 791 MB
```
#### Reason:
- Temp tables are used in some sql functions which are invoked very frequiently .

#### Solution:
- 1. This table need be vauum full to release the disk space and reindex the table's index.
If the system is online , use vacuum command will not be effective now. We would better
use vacuum full command to fix this issue.
```
vacuum full table1;
```
- 2. Replace the temp tables are used in the sql functions which are invoked frequently.  If 
the data set in the temp table is very large, i think the process should be redesigned. 
```sql
create type tmp.device as (sid bigint, name text,class_id uuid, id uuid);
create or replace function f() 
    returns set of tmp.device as 
$$                                                                    
declare 
  tmp_t tmp.device[];
  tmp tmp.device;
begin
  for i in 1..array_length(tmp_t, 1) loop
    --raise notice '%', tmp_t[i];
    tmp := tmp_t[i];
    raise notice 'sid: %,id: %,name: %', tmp.sid,tmp.id,tmp.name;
    -- 逻辑处理可以放在这里做
  end loop;
end;
$$ language plpgsql strict;
```
