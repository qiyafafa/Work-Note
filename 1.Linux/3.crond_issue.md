## 1.1 Error: crond dead but subsys locked

```
1. I try to start crond but when i run crond status I received 
    crond dead but subsys locked 
2. I deleted /var/lock/subsys/crond but still the same

3. Check the log files /var/log/messages and /var/log/crond, there are not any messages
about the crond service, intresesting. At the end find the /usr/sbin/crond was replaced 
by team.
