## 1.1 Error: crond dead but subsys locked
I try to start crond but when i run crond status I received :
    crond dead but subsys locked 

```
Debug:
1. I deleted /var/lock/subsys/crond but still the same

2. Check the log files /var/log/messages and /var/log/crond, there are not any messages
about the crond service, intresesting. At the end find the /usr/sbin/crond was replaced 
by team. 


```
