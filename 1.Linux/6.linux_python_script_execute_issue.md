#  1.1 Permission denied when python execute the py script
### Detail: /usr/local/bin/python3: can't open file 'migrate.py': [Errno 13] Permission denied
### Invoke: su - test -c "/usr/local/bin/python3 migrate.py"
### Fix :
    - migrate.py is a link, link to another file in site-packages, recreate the link use user test
    - set permissions of directory site-packages to 755
    - check whether user test has the access to file migrate.py in site-pcakges

## 1.2 Invoke python code in bash.
    - When there is symbol '$' we need add backslash '\' before it to transferred meaning.
    ```
    Because '$1' also will be recognize as a variable in bash. 
    ```
