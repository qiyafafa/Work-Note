# 1.1 python3: command not found
I have installed python3 , and when i run command "which python3" or "pythno3", it 
works normally as user root.

But when i run sudo python3 as user not root, it raise the error: python3 can not 
be found.

Reason: The defalt path in /etc/sudoers does not contain the path /usr/local/bin
```
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
```
Solution:
```
1. Use the absolute path when invoke a command : /usr/local/bin/python3
2. Add the path to default secure_path.

```

Solution 1 is better.
