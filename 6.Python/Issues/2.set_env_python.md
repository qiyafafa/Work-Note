## How to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before importing in python
The solution to this problem is to put this as the first line of a Python script (instead of the usual shebang):

exec env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/some/path/to/lib /path/to/specific/python -x "$0" "$@"

And here is how this works:
- with no shebang the current shell treats the file as a shell script,
- "exec" ensures that this first line is also the last command from this file executed by the shell,
- "env" is used here to set any environment variables, e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
- an exact path to Python's interpreter can specified or "env" can find one in PATH,
- "-x" is a Python's option which causes the first line to be ignored by the Python interpreter,
- "$0" is the script name, "$@" is substituted by positional parameters.

For example:
```py
exec env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/pgsql/lib/:/opt/VDC/jdk/jre/lib/amd64/server:/opt/VDC/tomcat/lib:/opt/ServerAdmin/lib:/opt/VDC/tomcat/lib /usr/l
ocal/bin/python3 -x "$0" "$@"

import os
import sys
...

```
